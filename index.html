                <h4>SEO with my own words</h4>
                <p>SEO is the way you mark upp your website, content, pictures and elements. By describing them with alt tags, descriptions so when people search for something, Google can provide the searcher with the best possible content. If you have not done this, Google will not find your site relevent. As the name says, Search Engine Optimization.This is the organic traffic as in not paid. You can advertise yourself to the first page on specific keywords, but then people will see that you've paid to be there AND every click will cost you money. Another important part of this is by links to and from your website. Well established domains linking to your website will help. </p>
